1. Question length: The length of a document might be
always the first to come up. For the prediction task proposed
here, question length somehow reflects whether the question
is explained in detail, thus it may be predictive. Here, we use
the number of words as question length.
4. Asker history: Experienced users are more familiar with
CQA service as well as the community and may be aware of
what topics are popular; while newcomers probably wonder
about what to ask or how to ask. Three features about the
1274
asker, the number of resolved questions asked, answers and
best answers, are employed.

6. Question subjectivity: One of the key characteristics of
CQA is that there are quite many subjective questions (Li
et al. 2008b). Subjective questions are those asking for answers with private states, e.g. personal interests, opinions,
judgments; on the other hand, objective questions require
authoritative information (Li et al. 2008a). Instead of classifying the questions and getting a binary label (Li et al.
2008a), we propose to simply count the number of subjective
words in a question to estimate subjectivity. The subjective
word list is from (Wilson et al. 2005)

Too short, unclear, vague or hard to follow. One of
the main reasons a question remains unanswered is that its
meaning is not clear to the community members. Missing
information and question format also contribute to not getting
an answer. As well, sometimes the code provided with the
question is hard to follow. The SO site specifically asks users
to be precise when posting a question. However, our analysis
shows that a large number of information seekers do not follow
this guideline.

Program specific without a program snippet or proper
explanation. Often a member asks a question that is specific
to a particular scenario in their program. Without seeing the
code segment or any detailed explanation of that code it is very
hard for another community member to answer the question.
For example, in the following scenario, a community member
is not provided the appropriate context.
